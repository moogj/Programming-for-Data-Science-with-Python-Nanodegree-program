### Project title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote Python code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a Python script that takes in raw data input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present the statistics.
